# RiftScholar 

A League of Legends platform that help players understand the game, learn the fundamentals and improve their performance consistently in every match


## Problem 

- Problem 1: The players sometimes struggle with learning basic fundamental because they don't know where, what and how to learn these, so they need : They may go to youtube for learning, but they cannot synthesize what they have learned

- Problem 2: Some players don't know exactly what are the effect of the items or when should they buy them, they just buy the default set items or buy the recommend items of the game : They go to websites or in the game for reading and learning the item, but these sources just point out the effect of the item, not how to do it ( to counter which champion )

- Problem 3: The players don't know how to pick champions based on the lineup or counter, they just pick because the champion is their favorite : Youtube but cannot synthesize too, sometimes, they see the champion counter website, but they don't know why this champion counter. 

- Problem 4: Players struggles or stuck in one rank for many months or years and don't know how to really improve them or what are their problems

## Solution & Key Features
How RiftScholar solves these problems?
- [Game Knowledge](https://rift-scholar.vercel.app/gameknowledge): In this section, player will learn the fundamental, the guide of the game. I hope thanks to this section, the player can have the deeper comprehension of the game. I divided it into three section: Beginer Guide (for newbie), Core Knowledge (universal concepts) and Role-Specific Knowledge (each-role)

- [Items](https://rift-scholar.vercel.app/items): This section covers all items in the game, including their effects, costs, and item categories. Players can learn when and how to use each item effectively, understand situational item choices, and identify which items are best for countering specific champions and strategies.

- [Champion](https://rift-scholar.vercel.app/champion): This section focuses on in-depth champion knowledge. Players can learn each champion’s playstyle, optimal builds, strengths and weaknesses, and how they interact with other champions throughout different stages of the game—early, mid, and late game. It also covers counter-picks and matchup strategies. The section is divided into three parts: Build, Guide, and Counter.
